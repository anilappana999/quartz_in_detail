#org.quartz.scheduler.instanceId = AUTO
In Quartz Scheduler, the property "org.quartz.scheduler.instanceId" with a value of "AUTO" is used to automatically generate an instance ID
for the Quartz scheduler,The instance ID is a unique identifier assigned to each instance of the Quartz scheduler,It is used for various purposes, 
such as distinguishing different instances in a cluster, enabling job and trigger recovery, and ensuring proper coordination among multiple 
instances.
#org.quartz.jobStore.useProperties=false
In Quartz Scheduler, the property "org.quartz.jobStore.useProperties" is a configuration option that determines how job data is stored in the job store. When it is set to "false,"
job data is stored as serialized Java objects in the job store. Conversely, when it is set to "true," job data is stored as properties.
refer table QRTZ_JOB_DETAILS for more details
#org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix=QRTZ
The configuration setting org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix in Quartz Scheduler allows you to specify a prefix that will be added to the table names used by the Quartz JobStore.

By default, the table prefix is not set, and Quartz Scheduler uses the following table names for its JobStore:

qrtz_blob_triggers: Stores blob triggers.
qrtz_calendars: Stores calendars.
qrtz_cron_triggers: Stores cron triggers.
qrtz_fired_triggers: Stores information about triggers that have been fired.
qrtz_job_details: Stores job details.
qrtz_locks: Stores lock information for Quartz instances.
qrtz_paused_trigger_grps: Stores information about paused trigger groups.
qrtz_scheduler_state: Stores state information of the Quartz Scheduler instance.
qrtz_simple_triggers: Stores simple triggers.
qrtz_simprop_triggers: Stores triggers with properties.
qrtz_triggers: Stores triggers.
qrtz_trigger_listeners: Stores trigger listener information.
qrtz_trigger_grps: Stores trigger group information.
If you want to add a prefix to these table names, you can set the org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix property in your Quartz configuration. For example, setting it to "MY_PREFIX_" would result in table names such as:

MY_PREFIX_qrtz_blob_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_calendars
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_cron_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_fired_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_job_details
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_locks
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_paused_trigger_grps
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_scheduler_state
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_simple_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_simprop_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_triggers
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_trigger_listeners
MY_PREFIX_qrtz_trigger_grps
Using a table prefix can be helpful when you want to distinguish Quartz Scheduler tables from other tables in your database or when you are using a shared database for multiple applications that use Quartz Scheduler.

Remember to refer to the official Quartz documentation or the specific version of Quartz Scheduler you are using for accurate details on the configuration settings and their usage.
#org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered = true
The configuration property org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered in Quartz Scheduler determines whether the scheduler should operate in clustered mode or not.

When org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered is set to true, Quartz Scheduler assumes that it is part of a cluster of schedulers. In clustered mode, multiple Quartz Scheduler instances can work together to share the load and provide high availability.

In a clustered environment, the job and trigger data is typically stored in a shared database, and each scheduler instance periodically checks the database for available jobs and triggers to execute. The scheduling of jobs is distributed across the scheduler instances in the cluster.

When org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered is set to false, Quartz Scheduler operates in standalone mode. In this mode, the scheduler instance functions independently without coordination or data sharing with other scheduler instances.

It's important to note that when operating in clustered mode, certain considerations and configuration changes may be required to ensure proper synchronization and coordination among the scheduler instances. For example, you may need to configure a JDBC JobStore and provide appropriate database settings for cluster coordination.

If you set org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered to true, make sure to follow the recommended clustering configurations and guidelines provided by Quartz documentation specific to your version of Quartz Scheduler

#org.scheduler.skipUpdateCheck = true
quartx will try to check updates from official site to skip that we can use this property

#org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateCLass = org.quartz.impl/jdbcjobstore.MSSQLDelegate

The MSSQLDelegate class is responsible for providing the necessary SQL statements and database-specific operations for interacting with Microsoft SQL Server.

#org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX

The JobStoreTX class is a transactional JobStore implementation provided by Quartz. It is typically used in conjunction with a transactional JDBC driver or a JTA-compliant database to provide transactional support for Quartz operations.

When using JobStoreTX, Quartz Scheduler ensures that the execution of jobs and the persistence of their state are performed atomically within a transaction. This helps to maintain data consistency and reliability.

#org.quartz.scheduler.overwriteExistingJobs = false
The configuration property scheduler.quartz.db.override-on-startup does not exist in Quartz Scheduler. It seems there might be a typographical error in the property name you provided.

If you want to configure the override behavior of existing job and trigger data on startup, you should use the org.quartz.scheduler.overwriteExistingJobs property instead.

To set org.quartz.scheduler.overwriteExistingJobs to false and prevent Quartz Scheduler from overriding existing jobs and triggers on startup, you can use the following configuration:

#scheduler.shutdown.wait-for-jobs-completion=false
By default, the value of scheduler.shutdown.wait-for-jobs-completion is true, meaning that Quartz Scheduler will wait for all jobs to complete before shutting down. This ensures that all jobs have a chance to finish their execution before the scheduler stops.

However, if you set scheduler.shutdown.wait-for-jobs-completion to false, Quartz Scheduler will initiate the shutdown process immediately without waiting for any currently executing jobs to complete. This can be useful in situations where you want to forcefully stop the scheduler without allowing running jobs to finish.

#org.quartz.jobStore.misfireThreshold=60000
The configuration property org.quartz.jobStore.misfireThreshold in Quartz Scheduler determines the threshold (in milliseconds) for detecting misfired triggers.

A misfired trigger is a trigger that was scheduled to fire at a specific time but did not execute due to some reason, such as the scheduler being paused or the system being under heavy load. When a trigger misfires, Quartz Scheduler needs to determine how to handle the misfire based on the misfire instruction set for the trigger.

The org.quartz.jobStore.misfireThreshold property sets the time threshold within which a trigger is considered misfired. If the time elapsed since the trigger's scheduled fire time exceeds this threshold, the trigger is considered misfired.

In your example, org.quartz.jobStore.misfireThreshold is set to 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This means that if a trigger's scheduled fire time is missed by more than 1 minute, it will be considered misfired.

The misfire threshold determines when Quartz Scheduler considers a trigger to be misfired and applies the corresponding misfire instruction. The misfire instruction specifies how the scheduler should handle the misfire, such as firing the trigger immediately or rescheduling it.

#org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount=10
In your example, org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount is set to 10, indicating that the thread pool will have 10 threads available for executing jobs and triggers concurrently.

The appropriate value for org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount depends on various factors such as the nature of your jobs, system resources, and the expected workload. It's important to choose a thread count that provides sufficient concurrency without overwhelming your system.
